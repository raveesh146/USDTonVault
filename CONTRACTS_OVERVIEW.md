# Copy Trading Vault - Complete Contract System

## 🎯 Project Overview

A decentralized copy trading vault system on TON blockchain where users can stake TON tokens in vaults that automatically mirror trades from designated professional traders.

## 📦 What's Been Built

### Core Contracts (3)

1. **Vault Contract** - Main contract for deposits, withdrawals, and trade mirroring
2. **Trader Account Contract** - Trader's account that emits trade events
3. **Trade Logger Contract** - Immutable trade history for proof of profits

### Supporting Infrastructure

- ✅ TypeScript wrappers for all contracts
- ✅ Compile scripts for all contracts
- ✅ Deployment scripts for all contracts
- ✅ Interactive scripts for testing
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (15+ tests)
- ✅ Complete documentation (4 docs)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to contracts directory
cd contracts

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build all contracts
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Deploy to testnet
npm run start -- deployVault
```

## 🎮 How It Works

### For Users (Investors)

1. **Deposit TON** → Receive vault shares
2. **Vault mirrors trader's trades** → Your shares grow/shrink with performance
3. **Withdraw anytime** → Burn shares to get TON back

### For Traders

1. **Execute trades** through TraderAccount contract
2. **Trades are broadcast** to connected vault
3. **Vault automatically mirrors** the trades
4. **Earn fees** from successful trading (future feature)

### Share-Based System

```
Your Value = (Your Shares / Total Shares) × Total Vault Assets

Example:
- You deposit 10 TON when vault is empty → Get 10 shares
- Trader makes 20% profit → Vault now has 12 TON
- Your 10 shares are now worth 12 TON (20% profit!)
```

## 🔧 Contract Operations

### Vault Contract

| Operation | Who Can Call | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `deposit` | Anyone | Deposit TON, receive shares |
| `withdraw` | Anyone | Burn shares, receive TON |
| `mirror_trade` | Trader only | Mirror a trade |
| `update_profit` | Owner/Trader | Update profit metrics |
| `emergency_pause` | Owner only | Pause/unpause vault |

### Trader Account Contract

| Operation | Who Can Call | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `execute_trade` | Trader only | Execute and broadcast trade |
| `set_vault` | Trader only | Link to vault |
| `withdraw_profit` | Trader only | Withdraw accumulated profit |

### Trade Logger Contract

| Operation | Who Can Call | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `log_trade` | Vault/Trader | Log a trade to history |
| `update_performance` | Vault/Trader | Update performance metrics |

## 📊 Example Usage

### Deploy System

```bash
# 1. Deploy trader account
npm run start -- deployTraderAccount
# Save address: EQAbc...

# 2. Deploy vault with trader address
npm run start -- deployVault
# Enter trader address: EQAbc...
# Save vault address: EQDef...

# 3. Deploy logger (optional)
npm run start -- deployTradeLogger
```

### User Operations

```bash
# Deposit 10 TON to vault
npm run start -- interactVault EQDef...
# Choose: Deposit
# Enter: 10

# Check your position
npm run start -- interactVault EQDef...
# Choose: View Only

# Withdraw half your shares
npm run start -- interactVault EQDef...
# Choose: Withdraw
# Enter shares to burn
```

### Trader Operations

```bash
# Execute a trade
npm run start -- executeTrade EQAbc...
# Choose: Execute Trade
# Type: Buy
# Amount: 5 TON
# Token: EQGhi...
```

## 📚 Documentation

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CONTRACTS_README.md` | Detailed contract documentation |
| `QUICKSTART.md` | Step-by-step deployment guide |

## 🔐 Security Features

- ✅ **Access Control**: Role-based permissions (owner, trader, user)
- ✅ **Emergency Pause**: Owner can pause vault if issues arise
- ✅ **Share-based Accounting**: Prevents inflation attacks
- ✅ **Safe Math**: Uses `muldiv` for overflow protection
- ✅ **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated
- ✅ **Error Codes**: Clear error messages

## 🎯 MVP Status

### ✅ Completed Features

- Share-based vault system
- Deposit and withdrawal functionality
- Trade event emission and mirroring
- Trade history logging
- Profit tracking
- Emergency controls
- Complete access control
- Full test coverage
- Comprehensive documentation

### 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Actual DEX integration (DeDust, STON.fi)
- Multiple vaults via factory pattern
- Automated profit calculation with oracles
- Performance and management fees
- Risk management (stop-loss, position limits)
- DAO governance
- Cross-chain support
- Advanced analytics dashboard

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Share-Based Accounting

Like a mutual fund - your shares represent your proportional ownership of the vault's assets.

### Event-Driven Architecture

Trader executes trade → Event emitted → Vault receives event → Vault mirrors trade

### Immutable History

All trades are logged permanently for transparency and proof of performance.

## 🚨 Important Notes

⚠️ **This is MVP code**:
- Test thoroughly on testnet before mainnet
- Get professional security audit
- DEX integration not yet implemented
- Start with small amounts

⚠️ **Gas Fees**:
- Keep ~0.5 TON for gas fees
- Deployment: ~0.05 TON per contract
- Operations: 0.01-0.1 TON each

⚠️ **Security**:
- Keep private keys secure
- Use emergency pause if needed
- Monitor vault regularly
- Verify all addresses

## 📞 Getting Help

1. **Read the docs**: Start with `QUICKSTART.md`
2. **Check examples**: Look at test files
3. **Review code**: Contracts have detailed comments
4. **TON docs**: https://ton.org/docs

## 🎓 Learning Path

1. Read `QUICKSTART.md` → Understand deployment
2. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` → Understand system design
3. Read `CONTRACTS_README.md` → Understand contracts
4. Run tests → See it in action
5. Deploy to testnet → Try it yourself

## 🏆 Summary

You now have a **complete, tested, and documented** copy trading vault system for TON blockchain:

- **3 smart contracts** in FunC
- **3 TypeScript wrappers** with full type safety
- **6 deployment/interaction scripts**
- **15+ comprehensive tests**
- **4 documentation files**
- **Ready for testnet deployment**

**Next Step**: Deploy to testnet and start testing! 🚀

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
npm run build
